In the fall of 2016, I attended a seminar given by the late Disney Legend and Imangineer Marty Sklar at EPCOT. Growing up on a healthy diet of Disney, I spent many days of my youth reading about Walt Disney Imagineering and the Designers and Engineers that built my favorite attractions in the Themed Entertainment Industry. Needless to say, I was thrilled to hear Marty speak about Herb Ryman and Linda Blair's artwork, as well as the history of Disney Parks. However, the best part was getting to ask a queston during the question and answer session following his presentation. I wanted to ask an intelligent question, perhaps one that he had not heard before, but I could not contain my desire to ask him that same old question that gets asked at many Imagineering presentations: How do I become an Imagineer? Marty gave sound advice. Never stop learning, collaborate as much as possible and if you're not failing, you're not trying anything new. In his book, One Little Spark: Mickey's Ten Commandments and the Road to Imagineering , Marty shares his 10 steps to providing great Guest experiences. My aim in the following pages is to translate Mickey's Ten Commandments for our field and help Software Engineers design creative and user-friendly experiences.
